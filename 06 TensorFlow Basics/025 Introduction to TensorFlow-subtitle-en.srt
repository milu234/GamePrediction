00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,640
Welcome everyone the tensor flow basics section of the course so I've already had a crash course on

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,180
the very basic libraries that we use of Python.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,040
And then we've already covered a very basic introduction to neural networks.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,160
Now it's time to use this section of the course to expand what have already learned and begin to actually

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,820
explore tensor Flo's framework approach to neural networks.

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,950
And hopefully you're going to be seeing lots of parallels with our own simple implementation that we

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,910
performed in the previous section.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,090
So let's cover what this section is actually going to do.

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,470
We're first going to start off with just going over the basic syntax for tensor flow and then we'll

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,650
discuss tensor flow graphs variables and placeholders.

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,730
And those are all going to feel very familiar based of what we've already covered.

12
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,640
Then we'll actually implement a tensor float neural network then we'll continue showing some simple

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,700
examples of using tensor flow for a regression task member that's supervised learning as well as a classification

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,060
task.

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,880
So we have to code along lectures one for aggression one for classification.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,430
Then to make sure you feel comfortable all the topics we've covered in the section we'll finish it off

17
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,340
with two exercises a regression task exercise and then a corresponding solution lecture as well as a

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,950
classification exercise.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
And again a solution lecture for that.

20
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,180
OK let's get started.

21
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,720
I'll see you at the next lecture where we began the basic syntax of tensor flow.
