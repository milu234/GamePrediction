00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,820
Welcome everyone to an introduction to neural networks in this section of the course we're going to

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,370
have a series of lectures that will cover key theoretical topics and aspects surrounding the neural

3
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:22,700
network model that is things like neurons percept trons activation functions as well as cost functions.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:29,680
Gradient descent and back propagation once we build a general very high level understanding we're going

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,220
to code out all of these topics manually with Python without the use of a deep learning library.

6
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:41,400
Basically we're actually going to try to do is manually create a very simple version of tensor flow.

7
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,560
Once you've actually built this by hand manually with Python we're going to move on to using the deep

8
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,840
library for this course tensor flow understanding a high level overview of these key elements is really

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,350
going to make it much easier to understand what's happening.

10
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:02,700
Once we begin to use tensor flow and tensor flow has direct connections to these concepts in its syntax.

11
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,180
All right let's get started.

12
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,520
I'll see you at the next lecture.
