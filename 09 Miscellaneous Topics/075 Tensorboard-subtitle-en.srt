00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,610
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture where we're going to be showing you an awesome visualization

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,280
tool that already comes built into tensor flow.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:18,600
And that is tensor board and it really allows you to visualize complex graphs and a very organized manner.

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,430
Keep in mind that we will be using the command prompt as well as the Jupiter notebook.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,800
So go ahead and open up either your terminal or your command prompt and make sure you have your environment

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,780
file ready to be activated.

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,790
Let's open up a Jupiter notebook create a simple graph and then visualize it ok here and at my Jupiter

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,620
notebook I've already imported tensor flow and what I'm going to do is just build out a really simple

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,860
graph session.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,010
I'm going to say T.F. is equal to T.F. and I'm going to add two numbers together.

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:54,030
They wanted to that I'm going to say B is equal to T.F. and three and four together and then I will

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,270
say C is equal to T.F..

13
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,600
And then I will multiply A and B together.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,950
So a very simple graph and then what I will do now is run the sessional say with t f session as SPSS

15
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,230
like and say session run.

16
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:18,850
And then I just actually need to run C and in fact I can print out the output of this so I can see it

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,590
and I get 21 which makes sense because I basically have one plus two here which is three and then three

18
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,130
times three plus four to seven.

19
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,010
So if through them.

20
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,140
21.

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,620
Now if I have a really complex graph I'm not going to be able to directly interpret it just using these

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,470
lines of code if I have more than just these three entries.

23
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,240
It's going to be really hard to basically trace back where all these variables come from.

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,980
So it'd be really nice if I could visualize that graph.

25
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,380
And that's actually really easy with tensor board.

26
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,060
So let's show you how you can do that will you end up doing is within your session where you're going

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,490
to do is the very first thing of your session.

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,090
You're going to say T.F. or excuse me writer is equal to see summary and then you going to call file

29
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,020
writer and you're going to create an output file location.

30
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:12,080
So I'll say it Dopp forward slash output and then of this we're going to save our session graph.

31
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,710
And then once you're finished running your operations you're going to make sure to close your writer.

32
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,920
So let's run that.

33
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:24,560
And right now we see the same result but if we take a look at where this trooper notebook is located

34
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,170
for my case it's located under miscellaneous topics.

35
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,880
If I come back to the miscellaneous topics folder click on the output folder I can now see this T.F.

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,800
events file.

37
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,670
And that basically has all the information about that graph.

38
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:41,050
So we're going to do now is open up our command prompt and show you how you can run tensor board.

39
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,610
So I will open up my command prompt and inside the command prompt the first thing I want to do is make

40
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,620
sure that I activate my deep learning environment.

41
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,880
The reason for that is because I need to make sure that I have tensor flow available in this environment.

42
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,140
That way I can call sensor board at the command line.

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,580
Otherwise you get some sort of error saying something like tensor board not recognized the next loops.

44
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,680
The next they're going to do is call a tensor board and then the following command.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,400
Dash dash.

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,570
Well make sure there's a space there.

47
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,940
So it's a little harder to tell my screen but I'm typing tensor board and then typing a space and then

48
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,930
I will say dash dash log directory is equal to.

49
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,490
And then if you're on Windows you may need to use double quotes here.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,540
And if you get an error of double quotes go ahead and try.

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,360
No quotes that kind of depends on what operating system whether you use single quotes double quotes

52
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,520
or no quotes at all.

53
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,020
So just keep that in mind and you're going Pathans pass in the same path that you created earlier.

54
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,610
So let me make sure I call the output.

55
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,450
So there it is support slash output.

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,340
And I can just do that because I'm located in the miscellaneous topics folder.

57
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,640
If you want to you can write the full path out here but since I'm located in the same folder I just

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,330
need to run that and I see centerboard running at this HTP.

59
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,990
So I will go ahead and copy this.

60
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,220
Make sure you don't copy of control c otherwise you're going to end up putting.

61
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,360
So in my case I just did it right click that and then I will go back to my browser and paste that in

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,770
and here.

63
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,360
Now we see this awesome visualization of my graphs.

64
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:17,600
So I have adding X and Y here add 1 x and y these two scalars and then they get multiplied and I can

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
click on one of these nodes and I can see the various operations the data types expects.

66
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,670
And then I can actually remove it from the main graph etc. and if you come over here to tensor flow

67
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,840
there's things like downloading it to a PNB file thing to a screen if you have a very large plot or

68
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,630
a graph you may need to do that.

69
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,390
You can see the various runs in case you randomly fill sessions of this.

70
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,390
You can upload graph files you can highlight this thing that says trace inputs.

71
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,640
In this case we actually have no placeholder input so we'll just turn that off and then you can also

72
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,020
see the graph essentially a legend telling you what the name spaces are.

73
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,890
The operation nodes constants etc..

74
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,870
Now as you can imagine if we have a ton of operations here this sort of automatic naming of add add

75
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,820
1 add to multiply and multiply 3 etc. isn't actually going to be very helpful.

76
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,300
So you can actually add names to your notes.

77
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,810
So let me come back here and show you how you can do that.

78
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:17,030
Basically every tensor flow operation has the ability of a parameter called name and you'll see this

79
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,860
often throughout a different storyline on line where they just assign names and if they never use centerboard

80
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,660
you might be wondering well why are they assigning the names.

81
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,450
If we never actually use them well they're for centerboard.

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,480
So let's go ahead and say this was our first ad operation and keep in mind you can't have spaces in

83
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,060
the string.

84
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,510
Otherwise we'll have an error there.

85
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:46,620
This name we'll say is our seconds at operation and then this multiply we'll give it the name of final

86
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,430
results.

87
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,590
So I'm going to run these again and let's refresh our Tencent board.

88
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,250
So when I refreshed tensor board if you take a look at what happens I end up getting my original graph

89
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,570
here as well as this new named graph.

90
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,670
So if you want you can edit that if we come back to our output folder you can see now I have T.F. events.

91
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,860
So I have my old one and the one I just created.

92
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,310
And also if you open up your command prompt it will basically report to you.

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,940
Hey I found a more than one Medak Raffy wants to run.

94
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,320
I move right in that graph with the newest event and what it means by overwrite is that it's overwriting

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,480
with a new graph here.

96
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,930
So it's adding that on top.

97
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,520
So it's technically showing two graphs if you wanted to edit that.

98
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,550
You could just kind of delete your old plot file or overwrite it cetera.

99
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,950
But again pretty good news here that we don't accidentally overwrite a graph because notice you're still

100
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,370
giving it the same output.

101
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:45,000
But luckily for us censor board and sensor flow is smart enough to know that you may not want to accidentally

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,130
overwrite your old stuff.

103
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,180
So basically just keeps adding to those crafty events.

104
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,640
All right.

105
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,440
So you can name stuff in your graph.

106
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,830
Well you can also do is add scope's.

107
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,650
So to do that we're going to add in a couple of more variables here.

108
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,380
I'm going to say 8 is equal to T.F..

109
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,710
And let's go ahead and add one hundred and 200 together and it will give us the name

110
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:19,310
a add the names aren't really important here is just for demonstration purposes we'll make another variable.

111
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:26,840
Well another operation really not really a central variable and this one's going to be called at 300

112
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:34,700
and 400 will name this be at.

113
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,690
And then we have this final result of C..

114
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,230
So what we'll do is we'll do the following.

115
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:45,720
We're going to add a two or multiply and B to.

116
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:55,110
So let's add those and we'll say A2 is T.F. and I'm going to multiply the result of an 8 1 and they

117
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,310
will say BE2 is equal to T.F..

118
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:05,960
Multiply the results of B and B one.

119
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,730
OK so we can so far follow along with the general logic because we kind of wrote this from the start.

120
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:17,200
But if you begin to just see this as code you kind of have no idea what's going on just at a quick glance

121
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:23,050
but luckily if tensor board will be able to see that now what we're going to do is we can see here that

122
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,780
our code is organized in blocks and we can actually project that organization with the use of scopes

123
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,540
in tensor board.

124
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:37,060
So what we end up doing is wow are the finance operations we can do the following we'll say with T.F.

125
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,840
name scope and then you pass in the name or what you want the scope to be called so we can say like

126
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,320
Operation a.

127
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,510
And then we have a colon here and then you write in as a block.

128
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,090
So just tab and dance all the operations you want to find within that scope and what that scope is going

129
00:08:54,090 --> 00:09:00,850
to look like with intenser board is basically a big grey box that it can expand.

130
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,200
So then the next thing to do here is say if name scope and this will be all be called Operation be

131
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,050
inlets in that this is now all go within the scope and you can actually have some scopes.

132
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,730
So if you have like another set of operations inside the scope you could have also had with T.F. name

133
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,180
scope operation you know Delta A or something like that.

134
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,280
OK so now we have these two scopes.

135
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,100
So let's go ahead and check this out.

136
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,470
So we'll run these again.

137
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,260
And now I'm getting a much larger number which kind of makes sense.

138
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:40,140
And if I refresh my tensor board what's going to happen now is this third graph looks a little different.

139
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,390
It now has these operations and those that are actually kind of named and what you can do is you can

140
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,460
expand these operations so you can double click on that plus sign and then see the graph that is within

141
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,220
that operation.

142
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,060
So there was my first that my 8 and I multiplied it and that's operation.

143
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,340
I can expand on this.

144
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,010
Click on that and then you can see operation B.

145
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,830
So now this allows you to organize really large graphs.

146
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,780
So when you see these really awesome pictures of tensor board running in action they're usually using

147
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,200
these operations so you can see here the really nice flow.

148
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,790
So we start off really simple graph that we named our nodes and then we group them together in operations.

149
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,690
And like I mentioned before we can have subgroups here.

150
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,340
So if you wanted a scope within a scope you could have done that as well.

151
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:21,650
All right.

152
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,810
Now so I want to know that there's actually a lot more to censor board than just visualizing graphs.

153
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,770
If you click here where it says interactive you can also see options for visualizing things like distribution's

154
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:36,310
histograms teks profile images and sensorial actually has really great documentation on this.

155
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,240
It basically has a censor board tutorial walkthrough for visualizing learning grafters ization histogram

156
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,030
dashboards.

157
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,530
But I also just want to walk you through not just graphs but also histograms.

158
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,690
So let's try to do that going to come back here to censor board.

159
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,310
And what I'm want to do is copy and paste some code this code directly from the documentation so you

160
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,680
can always reference it there or just copy and paste from the actual notebook for this lecture.

161
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,800
So I will copy and paste this but all I'm doing here is we're creating a placeholder k just like you

162
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,270
would.

163
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,280
And then we're making a normal distribution.

164
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,240
But what's interesting about this distribution is it has a shifting mean so it has the shape 1000 different

165
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,780
than normal but the mean is defined by this placeholder.

166
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,960
So basically have some sort of distribution that's slowly moving depending on this.

167
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,730
And then I'm going to record the histogram.

168
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:31,880
Now this T.F. summary histogram is a way that you can actually record things like variables or weights.

169
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,400
So if you recall back we're creating our own models we have T.F. variable you could pass that T.F. variable

170
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,680
here and then give it some sort of name or file path and then we're going to do is we'll create a session

171
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,390
here.

172
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,460
So let's actually say this.

173
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,730
Say with C-f session

174
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,300
as SPSS so it follows the same path we've been doing.

175
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,120
We're going to say that we have a writer it's equal to a summary writer and we're actually going to

176
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,770
follow this into another directory.

177
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:07,790
We'll say it goes to this temporary folder histogram example and then we'll say summaries and we're

178
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,930
going to say summary merge all.

179
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,460
And what this does is going to merge all your T.F. summaries into a single node.

180
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,210
So in this case we actually just have one T.F. that some recall but a lot of times you'll have lots

181
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,450
of histogram calls and you'll be able to see them all.

182
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,240
So we say T.F. that summary that merge all and then we're going to set up a loop.

183
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,640
So let's go ahead and do this.

184
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,590
Inside the session we're going to say Ed is equal to 400.

185
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,660
And we'll say for step in range and what we're going to do is say our current k value and make sure

186
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,510
my invitation is correct.

187
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,120
What's our current value.

188
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,990
Is it called Step divided by the flow then then we have this summary which is going to be some is equal

189
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,950
to session run you're going to run our summaries and we're going to feed it some feed dictionary of

190
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,510
those values which in this case is just that 400.

191
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,100
Are those values to 400.

192
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,990
And then we're also going to be calling our writer to add that summary.

193
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:04,990
And then at the very end of all this we're going to say writer and we're going to close that off.

194
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,380
OK let's go in and run this maternal on typos here.

195
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,890
And it looks like it ran correctly.

196
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,900
So what we're going to do is recall tensor board actually pointed to this histogram example because

197
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,800
right now it's just pointed at the output.

198
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,100
So we'll come back to our command prompt.

199
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm going to say control see here and then we'll say tensor board space dash dash log directory is equal

200
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:30,910
to.

201
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:36,470
And then we're going to pass that file so's I believe Tim and make sure I get the name correct.

202
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:42,720
It was his Gramp underscore example histogram underscore example.

203
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,870
So let's run that make sure we don't get any errors.

204
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,260
Ok looks like it's running.

205
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,170
So I'm going to now refresh this page.

206
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,230
So I'll come over here refreshed that you are ill.

207
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,120
And now I can see I have my distributions.

208
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,250
Next we see that distribution.

209
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,760
Let me zoom in here so you guys can see it as well.

210
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,330
And I can see here the distribution as it moves throughout the various values from where we have those

211
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,740
400 different values.

212
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,120
And then you click here on histograms and I can see what's really cool is this moving histogram.

213
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,940
And this is a really cool way to visualize your weights as they move and kind of center on some particular

214
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,420
values.

215
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,750
But again this is T.F. summary for histograms.

216
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,480
So essentially summarize them just to review that you call T.F. but some read the histogram you pass

217
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,500
and the name of what you want.

218
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,250
This particular one to be called in this case we called it moving mean.

219
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,360
And so if you come over here it relates as moving mean.

220
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,540
And then we can end up doing is merging all of them.

221
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,480
So you can have several histograms one for your biases one for your weights and you can check out all

222
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,520
those examples in the documentation.

223
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,770
All right so those are the basics of using tensor board.

224
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,270
Definitely check out the documentation.

225
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,280
There's lots of useful links there for you.

226
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,290
I'm going to just bring it in real quick so you can see it over here at my browser so you'll notice

227
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,890
that if you go to tensor flowed or slash get started.

228
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,210
Slash Well if you just go to get started here you'll notice there's lots of Tauriel.

229
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,470
But at the very end there's three full tensor board tutorial so visualizing learning of tensor board

230
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,900
there's also this great video here that's kind of really popular on YouTube where they discuss how tensor

231
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,280
board works.

232
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,620
They can come over here.

233
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,680
It'll give you more information.

234
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,940
There's also T.F. That's somebody that's scaler so you can do things like plot out your last throughout

235
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,420
time.

236
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,190
Summary operations etc..

237
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,140
It has tons of example code and it's relatively easy to understand now that you understand how to work

238
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,770
with tensor flow.

239
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:31,860
It's essentially just calling a summary scalar or summary histogram or summary file writer to whatever

240
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,970
you want to save.

241
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,820
So you can check out that visually like visualizing learning to Tauriel that's the main one.

242
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,440
And then there's also things like Graph visualization which you've actually basically already covered

243
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,330
so you can have those operations those nodes and then there's also the histogram dashboard which you

244
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,890
also basically cover it already for you.

245
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,480
All right.

246
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,820
So check that out.

247
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,400
It's a lot of fun to play with.

248
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,370
You won't use it too much throughout this course because we're really focused on learning tensor flow.

249
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:01,200
This is a really cool way to visualize and makes us feel look really pretty but it won't be the actual

250
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,230
main focus of a lot of our projects throughout the course.

251
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,630
Okay.

252
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,540
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
