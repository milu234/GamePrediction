1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,520
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:12,110
The course installation and setup lecture in this lecture will be showing you how to download Anaconda

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,730
how to restore the environment file that's included with the zip download for this course and then a

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,020
quick overview of Jupiter in case you haven't used that before.

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,510
Let's go to our browser and go to Anaconda.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,740
Com slash download.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,070
OK so here's the.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,620
Anaconda dot com slash download.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,600
And keep in mind sometimes Anaconda changes the look or styling of the site but the content should be

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,420
the same.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,010
It's where you can download the Anaconda distribution.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,280
The distribution is just a high performance distribution of a lot of data science packages for Python.

13
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,770
It's extremely popular in the data science space which is why we're going to be using it here.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,650
So the first thing we need to do is actually download the Anaconda distribution and it comes for the

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:59,710
Windows Mac OS or Linux or a boon to systems and windows a Mac OS pretty straightforward.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,260
You just click on whatever your operating system is and then download and then it's going to be a graphical

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,990
installer.

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,580
Basically just follow the steps that it says on the graphical installer.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,000
The Mac OS is essentially the same deal.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,150
Graphical installer click download and then follow the steps.

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,050
Linux if you click on that link it's going to be an installer for you which you'll have to download

22
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,140
and run at the command line.

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,230
So again you ever get stuck on either Windows Mac or us or Linux.

24
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,570
There's a really nice helpful links here that says how to install Anaconda.

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,490
You can go ahead and click on that and if you run Linux it will take you to direct commands for Linux.

26
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:41,440
So essentially you just in your browser download Yianna installer for Linux and then 2 is optional so

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,230
you can basically skip that and then three is the following to install an account for her Python 3.6.

28
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:53,320
So basically you just say bash and then wherever the location is of that SH file that you just downloaded

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,430
from Anaconda.

30
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,710
They can continue on the rest of these steps so that is for Linux.

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,490
If you come over here where it says installation it will then take you to the more detailed information

32
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,340
for Windows and Mac OS users.

33
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,150
You can click here on Windows and they'll say the Nikon installer and you can basically follow along

34
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,900
here.

35
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,500
Now there is a quick notes.

36
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:19,510
I want to make about installing with anaconda to your path variable to Lotus here.

37
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,090
One of the very first things you do as you're installing is to decide whether you want to add anaconda

38
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,940
to your path environment variable and Akala themselves recommend that you don't do this because it can

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,600
interfere with prior distributions of Python in your computer.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,170
We're going to assume that if your Delanie anaconda you want this to be your main distribution of Python.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,610
So make sure you click to add anaconda to your path environment variable.

42
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,980
That's a really important step.

43
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,230
If you don't end up clicking that what's going to happen is you have to add the PAF manually and if

44
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,390
you want you can do that as well.

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,080
But you might as well do it since the beginning.

46
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,830
So again to make sure you click on this word says add anaconda to my path environment variable.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,400
Even though it says not recommended we recommend that for this course.

48
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,160
All right so that's it.

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,410
Go ahead and install Anaconda and then we'll show you how you can restore the environment file.

50
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,310
Let's jump back to our desktop.

51
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,540
OK so by now you should have downloaded installed Anaconda onto your computer so it's time to restore

52
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,130
the environment file.

53
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,660
Remember that you should have downloaded the zip file by now from either the fakey lecture or the Course

54
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,610
overview lecture if you haven't done so.

55
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,760
Go back and view the course overview lecture.

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,600
Download the zip file that's a resource there and then unzip it somewhere on your computer.

57
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,770
Then the next step if you're a Mac OS or Linux.

58
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,050
Open up your terminal so that you can just do a search for terminal in your computer and you should

59
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,770
find it.

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,820
If you're a Windows user go ahead and open up the command prompt or CNID.

61
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,260
In other alternative is to open up the Anaconda prompt and that's especially useful if in case you ever

62
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,000
get errors like Konda not recognized as you go throughout this installation process.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,210
So again Windows users either use CMD.

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,720
Or if that's giving you trouble.

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,690
Use the Anaconda prompt again just search your computer for it or so once you're in your terminal or

66
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:08,510
command line where you're going to do is use CD to change directory to where ever the unzips course

67
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,500
notes are.

68
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:16,100
Then you're going to run the following command Kano's space Ian EMV space create space dash f space

69
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,550
FDL underscore Ian V Y and L.

70
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,110
So that's going to then use the environment file that's provided for you and create an environment that

71
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,140
we're using all the same versions of all the libraries we use while making this course.

72
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,130
Once you've created the environment file you can that activate it.

73
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,810
If you're on a Mac OS or Linux you're going to use source.

74
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,050
Activate T.F. deep learning that's the name of the environment.

75
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,100
If you're on a Windows computer then you're going to use just activate T.F. deep learning.

76
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,510
Ok so I'm going to actually walk through these steps on a computer.

77
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,880
So let's hop over to my command line.

78
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,820
OK so real quick I want to make the note again.

79
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,990
You should have already unzipped the tensor flow bootcamp file that zip file that comes from the resource

80
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,090
notes and have something that looks like this.

81
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,200
You'll see a bunch of folders.

82
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,670
If you click on one of these folders you'll notice that there's these IPY in the files so there's the

83
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,810
notebook files we'll be using throughout the course.

84
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,410
So again here you can see the IPY and B files and then also you'll sometimes see some data files.

85
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,110
So the other important thing to note is that you have the dot y m l file.

86
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,690
That's going to be the environment file that we'll be using for this course.

87
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,710
So we need to somehow get to this tensor flow bootcamp in order to do that we'll come over to our command

88
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,060
prompt.

89
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,250
So here I am now at my command prompt.

90
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,590
So all we're gonna do is use CD to get there.

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,810
Notice that I'm actually already here.

92
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:40,520
So in case you need to move around you can you see the dot dot and that will go back up a directory.

93
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,180
So if I did it again I would say CD that thought and now that my user directory if I need to go into

94
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,700
a directory I just say CD and then begin to type the directory's name and you should be able to then

95
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,030
tab autocomplete and it will auto complete the next directory over.

96
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,930
So then this has changed directory into the data courses and then it can change directory again into

97
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,240
tents or float bootcamp.

98
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,190
So again see the dot to go back up 1 and then see the dot and then her CD and then whatever the name

99
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,530
of your directory is to get there.

100
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,890
Once you're actually located in the tents flow bootcamp folder.

101
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,620
It's time to create the environment file.

102
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,450
So you're going to run the line you're going to say Konda space into the space.

103
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:29,230
Create dash F and then you'll say T.F. DL underscore E and V.

104
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,810
Y M L.

105
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,680
So this is basically telling conver to create this environment file and to double check that you're

106
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,160
in the correct directory.

107
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,490
You should be able to.

108
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,200
Once you start typing T.F. d hit tab and it should autocomplete for you.

109
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,490
If this is if it does not autocomplete that's probably an indicator that you're not in the right directory

110
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,590
so go ahead and then run this line.

111
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,340
Can the environment create FDL environment that why m-L.

112
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,790
So I've already run that.

113
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,340
Once you've done that and you've created the file it should be kind of a bunch of pop ups asking you

114
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,660
to create stuff or install stuff.

115
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,350
You may need to click y on your keyboard to give it permission to do stuff.

116
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,710
The next step is to actually activate the environment so that should have created an environment called

117
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,370
deep learning.

118
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,720
So then you're going to say activates or remember if you're a Mac or Linux you'll see source activate

119
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:26,710
T.F. deep learning enter and then you'll eventually see the falling imprint you'll see TFT learning

120
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,140
that's basically indicating that right now you're in this virtual environment of TFT learning if you

121
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,250
ever want to escape out of this environment.

122
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:42,780
You'll just say de-activate deactivates actually you just need to say de-activate.

123
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,070
There you go.

124
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,680
So again if you want to go into the virtual environment you'll say activate the learning or activate

125
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,780
TFT learning.

126
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,250
If you're on a Mac or Linux you'll see a source activate or source deactivate.

127
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,700
OK once you've done that what you're going to do is type Jupiter notebook and hit enter.

128
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,630
This should automatically open up a browser for you.

129
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,760
If it does not go ahead and copy this you are along with the token link if especially if it's your first

130
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,160
time ever using Jupiter.

131
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,070
So if you don't see your browser automatically pop up there should be a nice link here.

132
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,140
They can just copy and paste into your browser.

133
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,170
And remember to copy along with that token.

134
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:18,710
OK.

135
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,110
Let's hop over to the browser.

136
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,250
OK so your browser should look something like this in order to start a new notebook.

137
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,850
We're going to end up doing is say new.

138
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,690
And then underneath notebook you'll see Python 3 go ahead and click on it.

139
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,650
This may say something like Can the router default it should say Python 3.

140
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,560
But whatever is underneath this notebook.

141
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,500
Go ahead and click on it.

142
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,750
So here I have Python 3.

143
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,530
And then we're going to make sure that everything's working for you.

144
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:49,960
So we'll say import tents or flow as T.F. do shift enter to run a cell that you put Jupiter notebook

145
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:57,380
system uses cells and then we'll say hello is equal to T.F..

146
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:06,520
Constance you'll type the the string hello world do shift enter there and then you'll say S E S S is

147
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,830
equal to T.F. session and the way we'll will go over this code a lot more detail in the future.

148
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,200
This is just the check that senseful is working for you.

149
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,330
And then you're going to do the following you'll say Prince as Iesous that run an imprint c.s.

150
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,240
Hello.

151
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,850
So just passing in that hello variable you made do shift and try to run this you should get out a string

152
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,740
that says Hello world.

153
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,970
And that shows you successfully ran tensor flow on your computer and you are all ready to go.

154
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,780
OK.

155
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,820
So that's it.

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,260
If you already know how to use Jupiter you can go ahead and skip to the next lecture just now for one

157
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,850
or two minutes.

158
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,340
I'm going to go over a couple of things to know about the Jupiter note book.

159
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,290
So in the Jupiter note book you have this cell structure and the cell structure is really useful because

160
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:57,070
it allows you to basically segment portions of your code something else you can do is write Mark down

161
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,310
text into this.

162
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,150
So I going say View toggle header you toggle toolbar.

163
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,490
You may have already seen these I toggle it automatically if you want to change the name is no book

164
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,520
just click here on untitled and say something like my new notebook that hit rename that renames your

165
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:12,970
notebook.

166
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,090
So if you come back out tome you'll notice it's my new notebook now.

167
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:21,710
The thing is you can do is create markdown text so right now this is a code cell that I can change just

168
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,610
to be marked down.

169
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,910
And then I can write myself little notes here.

170
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,420
So here are some notes and then do shift enter to have those little notes.

171
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,540
And this also copies marked down commands so if you're familiar with Mark down you can do sizing or

172
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,630
italics those kind of things with those marked on commands in the notebook.

173
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,600
The next thing I want to show you is really useful and it's just tab and tab.

174
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,570
So if you create a string so say as is a string do shift enter to run that cell.

175
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,890
And then if you do as Dot and then hit tab you'll find a list of all the methods available for that

176
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,510
string.

177
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,680
Now keep in mind this string has to already be defined in a cell above.

178
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,620
If I try to do this in the same cell so I say x is equal to string and then within the same cell I say

179
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,430
X dots and hit tab.

180
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,530
Nothing's going to happen because technically the Jupiter note book doesn't know that this is already

181
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,650
a global variable.

182
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,120
You need to run the cell in order for that to work.

183
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,610
So then if I run this do X that tab then I can see everything.

184
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,620
Once you have that ready to go you can do shift tab off methods to see the doc strings and you can also

185
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,260
do this off functions.

186
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,700
So again you can do something like T.F. session and the new shift tab here and you should be able to

187
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,710
see the documentation string for any classes or functions or methods.

188
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,450
Remember these need to be defined before you can see anything.

189
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:44,830
All right.

190
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,840
That's really all we need to know.

191
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,220
But that Jupiter notebook again it's shift enter to run a cell if you want to input a cell.

192
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,850
You could just go to sell it or insert and then say insert cell above or insert cell below.

193
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,400
And that's really all you need to do.

194
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,680
All right thanks everyone.

195
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,670
I'll see you at the next lecture.
