Welcome everyone to the crash course review exercises.

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,580
So if you went ahead and went through those Crash Course Lectures we have a little note book as a quick

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,650
review of a couple of questions for you to answer so you can find that no book under crash course basics

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,600
crash course review exercises.

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,570
And there's also a solution note book that we're going to go through in the very next lecture.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,430
Let's quickly have a quick overview of the review exercises notebook.

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:28,660
All right.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,400
Here I am at the crash course review exercises notebook.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,500
The basic idea here is that you'll have some sort of instructions in bold and then a cell below for

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,910
you to execute them in for example the very first one just ask you to import the libraries that we've

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,000
been working with.

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,050
So you could say something like.

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,040
Import some PI and P and as a quick little tip.

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,940
If you do shift enter that will execute a cell.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,610
If you want to insert a cell below this one you can do alt enter and it will also execute the cell but

16
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,040
then insert a cell below.

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,790
So that's really nice that we can do.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,300
All tenter all tents are all tenter so you can insert cells below.

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,160
In case you need more cells or more space than what you want to do is non-firing them see that it asks

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,410
you to create a matrix.

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,440
Then later on after you create that matrix it asks you to do some sort of visualization of that matrix.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,700
They also ask you to do things like add a title add a color bar and then there's a little bonus aspect

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,230
to this.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,740
It asks you to how can you change the aspect of this show plot.

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,070
So there's a parameter called aspect there to play around with.

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,090
And notice there's a little link here that kind of gives you a hint.

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,990
Then you go ahead and use Panas data frame to read in that player Ray as a data frame.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,560
We actually should have to do that earlier in the lectures.

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,440
Then you'll create a scatterplot using panderers then you will scale the data to have a minimum of zero

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,820
maximum value of 1 using Cyke learn the preprocessing you went through.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,870
Then once you've done that you'll go ahead and create a data frame and then perform a train test pilot.

32
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,650
OK.

33
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,300
Basically right in line of everything we just covered.

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,110
Those are all the basic tools that we're going to be using throughout the rest of the course when we

35
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,750
actually discuss neural networks and sensor flow.

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,800
Thinks everyone in the next lecture will go over the solutions.
