00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,270
Welcome everyone to this lecture on a quick overview of data visualization will teach you how to use

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,860
Map plot lib for data is as well as Panoz built in data visualization.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,340
Let's open up a new chapter notebook and get started.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:24,120
All right we'll start off with a couple of imports here by pandas and then we'll also say import map

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:31,440
plot whipped up pipe plot as peel tea and the next thing we're going to do when working of Jupiter notebooks

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,610
in order to see the visualizations in line of the notebooks when you have this percent sign map plot

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,330
live space in line and that's known as a magic command.

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,530
And this magic command only works in Jupiter notebooks if you're not using a Jupiter notebook that means

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,520
that after you have all your plot code you need to get to type then appeal t show open and closed print

10
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,550
CS in order to actually see the plot.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,360
OK we don't need to do that since we're in the Jupiter note book.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,300
So let's actually show you do a really simple plot with Matt spotlit and most of the plots in this course

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,040
are going to be really straightforward we're either going to use that plotted to show an image or we'll

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,670
kind of show some sort of curvature song going to create an empire.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,660
Let's say zero to 10.

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:22,770
So if I take a look at X it's just 0 9 there and then we're going to say why is equal to x squared.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,800
And then in order to plot something like X versus Y you just say peel t plots and then x y enter.

18
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,920
And that creates this nice little to the line plot.

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,250
Now as a third argument what you can do is you can passen a string code for a marker and if you pass

20
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,970
an asterix there kind of puts some little stars if you pasan a color code such as for instance red it

21
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,650
will make that line red.

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,030
There is a lot more detail to this and it's not just a bunch of string codes to memorize if you shift

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,940
tab here.

24
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,550
There's kind of a list of arguments and if you expand on this it will tell you various things here.

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,910
So our Plus has read Plus's etc. and helps keep scrolling down.

26
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,090
Ill tell you the various characters description of the lifestyles as well as the colors that you can

27
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,160
add to it.

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,510
We really don't focus that much data visualization as course we just use really simple plots.

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,920
So really all you need to know is X versus Y and then some sort of string code that will allow us to

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,710
kind of differentiate this.

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,030
OK so kind of as a last example here we can do like a red dash line.

32
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:33,120
We have something like that something you may find yourself needing to do is to kind of edit the x axis

33
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,290
and y axis in order to do that in the same cell as replot command.

34
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,840
We need to do is say PLDT and you can passen X limits and then passing the limits.

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,760
So notice here that it kind of has some extra space after 0 if you want it's clear that you can kind

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,950
of hardcoded in set the limit at 0 and then maybe only want to go to 4.

37
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,240
So you pass that in and you can see now we have zero to for instance the y axis is still defined by

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,280
the original auto set Y axis.

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,830
What we can do here say peel t y Lim and make that go from let's say 0 to 10 and there we can see the

40
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,330
various points here.

41
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,020
And it's essentially just putting out the points and then putting a dashed line between them which is

42
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,970
why you zoom in it gets a little more jaggy.

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,890
And in case you ever want to put titles or X labels on your plot you can use Piazzi title to title your

44
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,780
plot.

45
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,350
So you just pass a string there and shows a title on top.

46
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,650
And I'm a little zoomed in here which is why it looks blurry or a little blurry so if I zoom out it

47
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:38,560
kind of starts getting a little clearer that we can say Piazzi to the X label to have some sort of X

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,490
label.

49
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,650
So to put an X there and then we can see now I have an X label.

50
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:50,730
And as you may have guessed I just kind of copy and paste this put a white label here make that label

51
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,370
I also get a white label.

52
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,150
Keep in mind all of these commands need to go in the same cell.

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,990
Otherwise matplotlib isn't really smart enough to know what plot you're referring to just with these

54
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,640
Piazzi commands.

55
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,750
In other plot there were going to be doing a lot especially when we work with images of convolutional

56
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:13,780
neural networks is in the show plot recension the kind of show and image on a to the array.

57
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,990
So I'm going to create a matrix will say derange 0 to 100.

58
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,600
And then I'm going to reshape this 10 by 10.

59
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,000
So if I look at my matrix is essentially just a bunch of values that keep getting higher and higher.

60
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,920
So if I wanted to plot this out as kind of a to the missional color scheme what I would expect is some

61
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,970
sort of color gradient that row by row it keeps getting brighter and brighter.

62
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,680
And also column by column it keeps getting brighter and brighter or darker and darker depending on how

63
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,110
you think about it in order to do that.

64
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:54,390
We need to say peel t show and this can take in a two dimensional array here and then define the color

65
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,950
by the actual value.

66
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:02,160
So if we just pass in our matrix here I can see what we expected which is a lighter and lighter color

67
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,420
mapping.

68
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,090
And you can actually declare what kind of color map you want using See map.

69
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,890
You can pass on a string code here.

70
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,300
You can check out the documentation for the various string codes but cool warm is another one here.

71
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,810
And if you accidentally spell something wrong and you scroll all the way down here eventually says hey

72
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,580
this color map wasn't recognized here are the possible values.

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,480
And there's tons of possible values here.

74
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,600
And you can check out the documentation see what each of these colors look like.

75
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,740
We can kind of grab one here and this one may or may not look that great with this data.

76
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,940
But here we have kind of a red yellow green so you can see stars red yellow to green.

77
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,510
So that's in show and just kind of showed again one more time.

78
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,810
Let's now create a random value here so say Ran's ants.

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,320
This goes to a thousand and then lets the size be 10 by 10.

80
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,600
So that's my matrix now it's just a bunch of random numbers.

81
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,880
So if I say peel T.

82
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,040
Show here.

83
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,670
On the Matrix now I can see kind of a bunch of random squares there.

84
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,410
And if you want a color bar all you have to do is say peel t the color bar offer this open close parentheses

85
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,030
and then you can see color bar in the case.

86
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,230
The range of the values themselves.

87
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,160
So that is map plot lib as far as plottings concern.

88
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,710
Pancho's actually has its own built in visualization capabilities that run on top of that plot lym kind

89
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,360
of more like a nicer API call from Appin the state of frame.

90
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,230
We don't use it a whole lot but just in case you're interested in it we can say Deia physical to PD

91
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,510
read CSFB we're gonna use that salary's file from last time as well.

92
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,410
And then if we check out that sellers file let's say we wanted to do a scatterplot of salary versus

93
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,110
age.

94
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:48,550
Then I can just say if plot's and then it's basically expecting an X A Y and then a kind of plot.

95
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,920
So I can do a line plot or I can do something like a scatter plot which makes more sense for three points.

96
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:02,410
So I'll say X and then as a string you just pass in the column name will say why is H.

97
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,070
And then finally we'll say the kind is a scatter

98
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,260
run.

99
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,760
And now we can see we have a scatterplot right off of our panel.

100
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,590
There's lots of different plot types that panned supports.

101
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,030
You can check the documentation we really won't be using that many of them but if you check out the

102
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,460
plot dot and then hit tab you'll notice the various kind of plots that panned the supports.

103
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,600
And these are all built off directly of Matt plotless which is why the styling looks so similar.

104
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,490
OK that's really all you need to know.

105
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:36,520
Will essentially just be using him show a lot for images and then we'll be using things like dot plot

106
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,500
for simple graphs.

107
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,800
OK thanks everyone.

108
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,670
See the next lecture.
