00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,270
Welcome everyone to the crash course basics section of the course in the section of the course we're

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,130
going to have just a few lectures that provide a very basic overview for some of the libraries we'll

3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:23,360
be using throughout this course such as pi pandas that live and pandas built in data visualization as

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,510
well as using sikat learn for pre-processing data.

5
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,120
Now keep in mind most of the time we'll be working directly with tensor flow.

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,460
We're really just using these libraries for kind of reading in our data manipulating it or cleaning

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,420
it just a little bit.

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,250
The main focus of this course is tensor flow and hopefully before you've even started this course you

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,570
already have experience and worked with these libraries in the past if you feel very comfortable with

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,500
these libraries.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,940
Feel free to just skip this section completely.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,620
Again this is really not meant to be a comprehensive overview of these libraries.

13
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,100
If you've never heard of these libraries before you may want to check out my other course Python for

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,870
data science or machine learning bootcamp before actually attempting discourse.

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,160
Again these are very basic overviews just enough for a quick refresher in case it's been awhile since

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,200
you've worked at the falling libraries.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,620
OK.

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,630
Let's get started.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,600
I'll see at the next lecture.
