00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,520
Hello everyone and welcome to your exercise for this section of the course where you're going to be

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,520
using convolutional neural networks to classify the famous see far 10 dataset.

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:22,110
So this is an optional exercise to see far 10 data set to see a certain data set consists of sixty thousand

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:29,830
32 by 32 color images in 10 classes with 6000 images per class where there are 50000 training images

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,210
and 10000 test images to make a total of 60000 images.

6
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,040
Now the reason this is optional is because it is actually quite challenging especially given what we

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,630
know so far about convolutional neural networks and the main challenge is actually dealing with the

8
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:50,050
data and creating tensor batches and making sure everything has the right dimensions and size actually

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,580
creating that convolutional layers and creating the pulling layers.

10
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,050
Given what we've already covered is pretty straightforward.

11
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,570
In fact it's almost the exact same process as what we've just heard before.

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,930
And you can actually vary some of the parameters.

13
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:09,490
The real hard part is getting this data as an image and then creating that next batch function or actually

14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,600
sizing it correctly.

15
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,440
Because remember with the data set all of that was taken care of for us under the hood.

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,200
When you're dealing with real data sets your own images or images that don't have these convenience

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,660
functions you're going to spend a lot of time actually creating those convenience functions.

18
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,650
And in the exercise notebook a lot of that's already been pre-filled out for you because it is a quite

19
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,020
challenging and time consuming.

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,950
So we're going to go through the exercise notebook and then you can decide whether or not you feel like

21
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,080
just treating this as a code along lecturer so you'll skip to the solutions lecture and code along or

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,640
feeling a little more ambitious just try your best and see how far you can get on your own through the

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,020
exercise notebook.

24
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,560
So let's open up that exercise notebook and show you where you can find the data.

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,750
Ok so here I am under the convolutional neural networks folder.

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,480
You should notice that there is a CNN project exercise notebook file go ahead and click on that one

27
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,890
and you'll also notice that there's a folder here called See four batches dash pi.

28
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,150
That's where the actual data is contain and it comes in five little batches here.

29
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,520
So keep that in mind and when you open up the exercise notebook you'll notice that there is a description

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,810
of what you're going to end up doing.

31
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,210
You're essentially going to be classifying between 10 classes or color images and you're going to follow

32
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,650
along with the instructions in bold.

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:29,150
Now step 0 called get the data actually already has all of this essentially filled out for you.

34
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,750
So you're going to load the data and you're going to use the code here.

35
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,210
That's already been made for you.

36
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:40,160
And the reason for this is it is really time consuming process and you're basically going to have to

37
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,020
manually convert these images and create these next batch convenience functions.

38
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,370
And because that's really time consuming and it doesn't actually have a lot to do of convolutional neural

39
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,120
networks it's more just kind of the dirty work of working in a python.

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,900
It's already been filled out for you so you can focus on learning about convolutional neural networks.

41
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,750
So if you scroll down here there's a lot of explanation about the data how it's formatted.

42
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,720
So there's tons of text.

43
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,850
You're free to read through then displaying a single image using that plot lib.

44
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:14,720
There's also little examples of showing that so there's some code here that says you need to fill this

45
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,010
out.

46
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,170
Put the code here that transforms the X array etc..

47
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,300
And once you're done kind of dealing with the data there is a little helper functions here such as the

48
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,430
one high end coding.

49
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,390
Then there's also a class that I made for you to set up the images of training setting them up and then

50
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,850
grabbing that next batch.

51
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,770
And it shows you how you can use the above code then you'll get to the create model.

52
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,130
And that's where you end up having a bunch of empty cells free to fill out.

53
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,220
And then she wants you to recreate those helper functions that we did earlier basically going to look

54
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,260
really similar to the ones we did in the dataset.

55
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,630
And if you want you can just kind of copy and paste if you forget what they look like then you'll create

56
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,610
the layers again.

57
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,040
And there's hints here on what shapes and what sizes to use.

58
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,170
So you can scroll down loss function optimizer graph session etc..

59
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,020
Now keep in mind this is going to take a long time to run.

60
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,090
I have a really fast computer so I ran it for let's see River 5000 steps and got 17 percent accuracy.

61
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:14,780
So we should kind of aim for around that and again kind of the whole half our first half of dealing

62
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,650
with the data.

63
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,800
It's been technically fill that for you.

64
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,060
But what I really want you to do is if you try to do this as an exercise go line by line and make sure

65
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,520
you understand a lot of this code actually that even write it.

66
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,840
It comes with the data set itself.

67
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,010
So for instance is an pickling function that actually if you go to the link of where to download the

68
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,790
data.

69
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,530
So if you come over here to download data and click on this link they'll take you to the data source

70
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,700
and then if you scroll down here the providers of the data actually kind of have instructions here of

71
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,610
how to open the data and pickle it etc..

72
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,880
So this is actually the code that's directly here in the notebook.

73
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,360
So if you're an independent researcher and trying to work this data you would've already had this code

74
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,980
available for you anyways.

75
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,000
And this is just kind of some convenience functions to working the code.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,620
OK.

77
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,840
So take your time with this project.

78
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a it's pretty challenging to be perfectly honest as it should be convolutional neural networks

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,330
are not the easiest thing in the world.

80
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,120
So take your time with this see how far you can get.

81
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,100
Again if you're going to do it as an exercise please make sure to read and go step by step through what

82
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:28,320
is the step zero of getting the data before you jump forward to actually creating the network.

83
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,110
So all of these cells need to be run.

84
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,840
You should be understanding every line as part of the exercise and will be going through that throughout

85
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,620
the solutions before you actually end up creating the model.

86
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,470
So don't just skip to create the model.

87
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,670
Make sure you understand all the code before it.

88
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,510
All right.

89
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,420
So coming up next we're gonna have a series of lectures going through this project and treating it as

90
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,950
a code along solution.

91
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,830
Again it's optional it's up to you whether you want to treat it as a code along.

92
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,910
If you ever get stuck during the exercise please check over to the solutions video where we'll have

93
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,360
full explanations for all the steps.

94
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,320
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
