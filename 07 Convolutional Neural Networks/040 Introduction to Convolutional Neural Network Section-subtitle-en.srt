Welcome everyone to this section on convolutional neural networks in this section we're going to be

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,670
covering several things.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,780
We'll start off with a quick review of previous topics and neural networks then we'll discuss some new

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,030
theory topics that will help set up your learning for convolutional neural networks.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,840
We'll also discuss the famous EMIs handwritten digits dataset.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,030
Then we're going to solve the classification problem of this with a quote unquote normal neural network

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,840
set up.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,100
We're going to learn about the theory behind that convolutional neural network and then we'll revisit

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,690
the problem and solve it.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,280
Convolutional neural nets.

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,550
After that they'll have the convolutional neural network exercise and the solutions afterwards.

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,070
All right let's get started.

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,110
I'll see you at the next lecture.
