1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,410
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,490
In this third part of our Arnon with tensor Flo's lecture series we're going to be practicing generating

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,040
a new sequence So previously we created a time series sequence that shifted just one time step over.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,060
Now let's go ahead and generate a completely brand new sequence.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,930
So we're going do the following.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:33,630
We'll say with T.F. session as SPSS we're going to say Savir all restore the model I say.

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,530
So session and then go ahead and find it.

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,170
So this one I believe is called R and in time series model code along and is going to pass that and

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,780
right there and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to first seed it with just a bunch of zeros and

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,950
let's see what happens.

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,750
So I'll say zero sequence seed.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,480
Let's zoom in on level here.

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,730
Scroll down a little bit.

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,370
So zero sequence seed that's going to be equal to zero point zero.

15
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,160
For i in range I will say a number of time steps.

16
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,900
So 30 right there.

17
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,320
And then I'm going to do the following.

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:26,940
I'll say for iteration in the range of the length of TS data X data Minus the number of times that it's

19
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:39,430
going to perform the following will say X Bachche is equal to an array of zero sequence Seeta and only

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,550
go from a negative number of time steps all the way to the end and then going to reshape this to be

21
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:54,340
in the proper format for r r n n which is going to be one number of time loops one underscore number

22
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:02,950
of times steps comma 1 and then we need our Y prediction or should I say white generated and that's

23
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:14,400
going to be to session run and we'll run the outputs where the feed dictionary is just equal to x the

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,040
X that we just created there.

25
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,320
And then finally it will say zero.

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,000
Sequence seed.

27
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,900
And I'm going to pen those y prediction values 0 negative 1 0.

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,740
So I need to index that using pi indexing so I'm in zoom out here.

29
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,720
So again all we're doing is we're going to create this zero sequence scene.

30
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,230
So that's just going to be 30 zeros or however many number of times that we have.

31
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,840
And then for iteration in the range of the length of time series X data Minus the number of times steps

32
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,870
what are going to do is generate an X batch.

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,710
So that's going to be passing in the zero sequence array going backwards a negative number of time steps

34
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,800
then go all the way to the end that I you to reshape this for the recurrent neural network.

35
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,300
So anyone come the number of times that's one.

36
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,880
Then I have my prediction.

37
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,350
So I'm just running the outputs passing in that feed dictionary of the next batch I just created up

38
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,000
here.

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,150
And then finally I need to append those new values to Mizer a sequence seed.

40
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,950
So at the very end I should have 30 zeros and then the generated values so let's go ahead and run that

41
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,910
and plot it out.

42
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:34,920
We'll say PBT plot data X data versus zero sequence seed.

43
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:46,000
And we'll go ahead and have this be a blue line and then also going to plot theist data X data and this

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,880
is only going to be for the number of time steps.

45
00:03:48,910 --> 00:04:02,210
So a number of times steps that are going to plot zero sequence seed number of time steps and then finally

46
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:07,660
will have this be a red line hopes are what make this a little thicker.

47
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,980
Just so we can see it.

48
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:19,900
So line with is equal to three and it's going to give this an X label of time loops and we'll have wild

49
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,060
label be just white.

50
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,890
So this first one right here that's putting in the entire time series and the second one is going to

51
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,030
be a red line in the case.

52
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,100
The first seed value OK is when we take a look at our results here.

53
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,480
We're definitely providing something that looks sinusoidal but it ends up generating from let's say

54
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,360
negative 0.5 to 1.

55
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,520
So it's not exactly generating a pure sine wave but it's definitely learned that sort of behavior.

56
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,940
So let's go ahead and seat it with something that is the true first sign value.

57
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,860
And let's see how it does with that.

58
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,410
So we'll end up doing is the following.

59
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,510
I'm going to copy this right here.

60
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:08,270
And paste that and then we'll say time series come along and we're going to see this with the actual

61
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,960
values.

62
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:16,590
So instead of a zero sequence seat what I'm going to do here is say training instance is going to be

63
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,600
equal to a list of TS data y true values.

64
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,570
And we're just going to take 30 points there.

65
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,620
So then instead of the length of test data the X data minus the number of times steps when I get in

66
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:37,370
that doing just say the length of the train instance that I just created that X Bache instead of being

67
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:44,800
zero sequence seed is going to be that training instance instance.

68
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,640
There we go.

69
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,900
And then that needs to have the same dimensions so that reshape is fine as well.

70
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,310
So this line stays the same.

71
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,900
And then instead of appending it to zero sequence c I'm going to append that to the tree instance.

72
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,350
There we go.

73
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,940
So now we're going to run that.

74
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,040
All right so let's plot this out and then scroll back up here and I'm going to copy this and replace

75
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,280
what's necessary.

76
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,290
So instead of saying X data with zero sequence seed.

77
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:18,340
Now since I actually have a real training instance I could just say TSC data versus Y true.

78
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,910
And then when I got to end up doing is saying the X data X data is fine but replaced this zero sequence

79
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,440
seed with the training instance OK.

80
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,200
That's going to have a saying that mentions.

81
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,010
And let's run this and we can see here.

82
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,340
Now we're predicting pretty much inexact sinusoidal wave.

83
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:41,020
Now these results won't be perfectly equal to sign of X but they're going to be pretty darn close because

84
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,480
our seed was much better.

85
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,250
Now keep in mind sometimes you'll get weird exponential values especially for the first one.

86
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,470
You may get something that just looks flat and then suddenly explodes.

87
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,920
If that happens to you then usually a good fix for it is just running everything again because sometimes

88
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,720
the graphs session wasn't saved properly and either reset the default graph.

89
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,680
So in that case if you ever get that urge just come over here to colonel and say restart and run all

90
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,680
and make sure you use the provided notebook.

91
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,350
It's really easy to get a typo in here or mess up a line or just mix up the graphs.

92
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,630
So again always use the provided notebook because there's lots of ways to just make small typos and

93
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,790
mess this up.

94
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,310
All right so I hope you enjoyed this lecture series.

95
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,100
I think this last part is really one of the most interesting aspects of our current neural networks

96
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,920
the ability to just completely generate new sequences based off what it's seen before.

97
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,050
And what's really cool is the pinning on the seat value you make it something unique and different.

98
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:41,230
So you can imagine that if we were trying to generate something like music or we had words we could

99
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,920
give it certain seeds and it would generate a unique instance that we've actually never seen before.

100
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,530
So this is the cool way you could use recurrent neural that works to maybe journey new pieces of music

101
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,220
or something similar to that.

102
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,140
All right.

103
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,950
Hope you enjoyed that.

104
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:59,180
Coming up next it's going to be an exercise that allows you to walk through this for a time series.

105
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,700
Thanks.

106
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,820
And I'll see you at the next lecture.
