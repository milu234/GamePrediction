Hello everyone and welcome to the section on recurrent neural networks.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,770
We've used neural networks to solve classification and regression problems and we've also learned how

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,570
to use convolutional neural networks to solve image classification problems but we still haven't seen

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,880
how neural networks can deal with sequence information such as a time series.

5
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,920
So for this we need to learn how to use recurrent neural networks.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,900
There's lots of interesting stuff are going to learn about the sex for the course.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,710
We'll start off with a basic overview of our current year old that work theory that we're going to manually

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:41,020
implement a very basic recurrent neural network they will learn about some specific subtopics such as

9
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,910
vanishing gradients and specialized units such as a long short term memory unit.

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,040
Then we'll show you how to do a time series analysis with a current year that works trying to predict

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,030
a time series shifted one step into the future.

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,290
Then you'll have your own time series exercise along phase solutions lecture and then we'll also discuss

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,850
worts of VEC algorithm for word embedding.

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,400
All right.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,410
There's lots to talk about so let's get started.

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,330
I'll see at the next lecture.
