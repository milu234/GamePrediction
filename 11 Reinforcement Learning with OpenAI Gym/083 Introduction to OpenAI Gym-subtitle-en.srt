00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,150
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,990
We're going to be discussing open aiight.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,570
Jim what is the toolkit open.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,280
AI is the basic nonprofit organization that's behind this tool kit.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,810
And then we'll also discover the documentation behind open eyes.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,660
So first off let's discuss what is open A-I open and it is a nonprofit AI research company.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,330
You may have heard of opening before due to its ties with people like Elon Musk or Sam Altman and their

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:38,750
basic motivation is to help discover and enact a path to safe artificial general intelligence.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,510
If you follow the mosque and his comments on the dangers of artificial intelligence you may already

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:52,010
have some familiarity of this but basically open he is trying to bring a path forward where the basic

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:58,670
research of artificial intelligence is more shared more collaborative more open in hopes of enacting

12
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,490
a safe path for the general development of artificial intelligence.

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,710
So what ends up happening is that they released this toolkit called Jim.

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,410
So that's what we're actually going to be working with open aiight Jim.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,370
And that's a tool kit the AIDS in developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,220
There's two parts to open AI Jim and the part we're really going to be dealing with is the open AGM

17
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,710
library and the Python library.

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,250
That means we're actually going to directly import it will say import Jim and you can use pipin knowledge

19
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,220
him to install it.

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,270
But it's a python library with a collection of environments that you can use with your reinforcement

21
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,560
learning algorithms.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,950
And basically before opening I Jim it was quite difficult to try to get some sort of general environment

23
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,220
for your reinforcement learning algorithms.

24
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,740
But now with opening gym it becomes a lot easier to test reinforcement algorithms on the same environment

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,700
as someone else on a computer.

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,340
Maybe half the world away.

27
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,230
So it makes it really convenient to build models and compare models.

28
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,650
So we'll be using the Python library.

29
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,170
There is another aspect of open the gym that I want to talk about.

30
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:13,290
We won't really be using it but it's the open gym service and it's a site in API we can compare algorithm

31
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,320
performance on the environments the opening gym provides So what we're going to do is we're going to

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,200
explore the official documentation before diving into work.

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
Opening gym with Python.

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,950
Just seeing it a little bit more familiar with what the actual documentation pages look like.

35
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,830
So open up your browser and go to gym.

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,960
Open AAE dot com or just do a quick Google search for open gym.

37
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,240
And so probably the first page that pops up.

38
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,450
So let's open up our browser and head to that.

39
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:39,810
OK.

40
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,450
Here I am in my browser.

41
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,870
If you go to gym opening dot com it should automatically link you back to the page.

42
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,510
So here you can see the open aiight gym is totally open source.

43
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,220
You can check out all the code all the examples et cetera as well as the documentation page.

44
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,600
But in case you're having trouble finding this one I want to do show you how you can get this just from

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,950
going from opening his official Web site.

46
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,920
So let's hop over to that here am.

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,450
Opening night dot com.

48
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,340
A lot of times it changes what the actual home page looks like but you should see some sort of link

49
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,340
to their systems either down here or over the top navigation bar.

50
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,330
So you click on systems and eventually somewhere along this page you should see.

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,690
Jim says Jim the open air that.

52
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,090
You'll go ahead and click on that.

53
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,300
It'll take you to Jim the opening column which currently links to this page.

54
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,180
So if you scroll down on this page eventually you should see that it has some link for the documentation.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,590
So you click on that and it will take you to the more documentation like page and then you can hit here

56
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,440
on view documentation.

57
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,350
And here is the official documentation for opening night Jim.

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,460
So this is what we're going to be learning about.

59
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,850
And as I just mentioned it consists of two parts the open source library which is mainly what we're

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,100
going to be dealing with and this is basically a collection of environments.

61
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,360
So that's the really hard part that Jim has basically taken care of for you if it's providing you with

62
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,500
environments that you can have your agent interact with take actions upon etc. to try to find some sort

63
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,570
of reward.

64
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,610
So if you click here on environments you can check out the various environments are.

65
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,610
So there's a bunch of the free environments right now and depending on when you're viewing this page

66
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,410
sometimes those pictures don't load.

67
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,920
But there is a cart pulling environment which that's the main thing we're actually going to be messing

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,710
around with.

69
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,520
But there's also a boardgame environment such as go.

70
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,060
So if you ever heard of Google's deep mind you're probably familiar go there.

71
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,970
And then there's also Atari games such as aere Pac-Man alien cetera.

72
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,190
Keep in mind some of these environments such as Atari require additional libraries to install such as

73
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,690
an Atari emulator.

74
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,520
So we're only going to be dealing with these classic control problems that don't require any additional

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,420
libraries.

76
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,740
If you do require other environments go ahead and read the official documentation and additional libraries

77
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,540
you need to install for this course.

78
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,820
We're going to try to keep things as simple as possible for our reinforcement learning lecturers so

79
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,460
we'll only deal with things that don't require an additional library beyond Jim.

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,860
So we have a Tory board games Toltecs safety.

81
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:14,460
There's even Minecraft there's soccer there's doom etc. So lots of stuff here on these environments

82
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,810
and you can check the documentation as well.

83
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,660
And there's also even a forum they can click around and play around with.

84
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,570
OK.

85
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,290
So that's all I wanted to show you.

86
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,290
As far as opening night Jim is concerned we're going to do in the next series of lectures is actually

87
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,430
show you how upon installing opening a gym how you can interact with it as a Python library.

88
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,300
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
