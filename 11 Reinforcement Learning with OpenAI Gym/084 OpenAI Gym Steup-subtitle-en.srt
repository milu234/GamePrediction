00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,350
Hello everyone before we actually get started with coding.

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,640
Opening night gym.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:16,460
What I want to do is cover just a few basic setup and best practices when working with the gym library.

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:24,040
So let's go ahead and review the best practices with open gym for working of opening night gym.

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,250
I actually recommend that you use either a text editor or an integrated development environment instead

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,850
of a Jupiter notebook.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,930
What we're going to be doing of that opening gym is rendering some to them mentionable drawings or environments

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,000
and sometimes those renderings have issues of Jupiter notebooks.

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,490
So what I recommend doing is using either a text editor such as subline text editor or Adam text editor.

10
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,090
A simple Google search of those will just take you straight to the download page or if you want.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,730
You can use a full integrated development environment such as pi charm and or basic set up is going

12
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,550
to be to code out the PI files or the high scripts in the editor and then execute the code at the command

13
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,100
line.

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,100
There are many possible plug ins for subline Texan Adam text editor that alive.

15
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:15,110
Also have the command line or the terminal directly inside those text editors open AI.

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,590
Thus again technically work in the Jupiter notebook but sometimes the pending on your operating system

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,740
running multiple renderings of an environment can lead to freezing or just very slow behavior of the

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,410
gym.

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,900
So it always works when we run up Paice groups so that's what we're going to be using for this course.

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,550
That way in case you're using another operating system you don't get hung up on any errors but you can

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,810
if you want attempt to first off use cheaper notebooks.

22
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,050
OK so we're going to do right now is quickly check the opening.

23
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,730
Jim is installed and also show you how to run a PI script as well as going through how you would download

24
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,420
a text editor if you need it.

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,020
And I want a quick note here please feel free to use any either text editor or development environment

26
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,630
configuration you prefer.

27
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,290
So we're going to be using atom for this series of lectures.

28
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,320
It's a open source free text editor from hub.

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,770
And remember you have many options including just ticking of Jupiter notebooks in case you prefer that.

30
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,970
So right now we're going to open up our browser and go to Adam.

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,460
Let's hop over to that.

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,530
OK so here we are.

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,470
Adam Oh Adam is just a basic text editor.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,870
It's open source and it's free is provided from get hub and depending on what operating system you're

35
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,210
using you should see a download button here.

36
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,210
If you're on Windows you see the windows installer if you're on a Mac you should see the Mac installer.

37
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,660
And if you're on Linux or Bluetooth should see some sort of download of either S.H. file or some sort

38
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,950
of installation file.

39
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,420
So go ahead and click on that and install the Adam text editor.

40
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,350
It's a basic text editor and it's going to provide us things with syntax highlighting for that py files

41
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,320
etc..

42
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,740
So go ahead and download that and then I've already downloaded it.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,270
Open it up on my computer.

44
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,810
Let's jump to that now.

45
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,440
All right so once you open up Adam the first time it should look something like this.

46
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,220
Well we're going to do teach you one last thing which is how to install a terminal package.

47
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,600
That way you don't have to keep jumping back to either command prompt or terminal but instead you can

48
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,480
have a terminal directly in the Adam text editor.

49
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,180
This is optional you don't need to do this.

50
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,170
You could always just open up your terminal command line separately and run up high script from there.

51
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,940
But let me also show you how the general insulation package works and that them click here where it

52
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:28,240
says install a package and then say open installer and that will open up this page and then you search

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,100
packages.

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,930
So you're going to search for terminal and then hit enter and then it will say the featured packages

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,700
and it's going to say searching in packages for terminal and eventually you should see in this dropdown

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,200
list the platform you dash the terminal.

57
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,340
And this is the package that allows you to have basically a little plus sign that open up a command

58
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,410
line directly in the Adam text editor.

59
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,480
So I already have it installed but you should see a little Install button there.

60
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,520
If you can't find that just by searching terminal go out and search the entire name platform you know

61
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,250
dash ID dash terminal install it and if you ever want to mess around with the settings you can do is

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,740
click here in settings and this will take you to the platform your ID settings and as you scroll down

63
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:14,530
here what I recommend you do if you're on a Windows computer is to override the shell sometimes by default.

64
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,910
It uses power shell.

65
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,370
You can go ahead and copy and paste this line right here in and send it to your Siham the executable

66
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,150
file.

67
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,680
That way it launches the command prompt.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,590
It's sort of the power shell.

69
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,340
Once you've done this you may need to restart items to go ahead and close out them again and open it

70
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,910
up.

71
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,230
Once you've done that you should see at the very bottom a little plus sign you can click on that plus

72
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,020
sign and that opens up a new terminal for you.

73
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,660
And here you can run things such as straight python from the command line so you can get Python and

74
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,810
they have this little terminal in your text editor.

75
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,310
So let's go ahead and quit this and let's practice and make sure that we have Jim installed onto our

76
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,170
computer.

77
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,610
So where are you going to do is you're going to activate C-f deep learning environment.

78
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,610
We've been using.

79
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,950
And Jim should already be installed in T.F. deep learning.

80
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,060
But just in case it isn't you can use Pipp install Jim enter.

81
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,970
And you should see it installed Lotusphere already get the requirement already satisfied because they

82
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,360
already have gym installed.

83
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,450
Once you've done that you can go ahead and run a thought PI script.

84
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,380
In this TFT planning environment let's review how to do that.

85
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:29,120
So we're going to just say file will save new file and this will open up a new file here and we're just

86
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,970
going to say import Jim and then we'll print out.

87
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,090
It works right now.

88
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,680
There's no syntax highlighting because I haven't actually named this or save this so I'll say file or

89
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,150
list control SLB easier just control as or commands.

90
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,380
And then you can save this wherever you want.

91
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,290
So since I'm under C users Marsat right now I will save it there.

92
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,410
So I've moved over to that directory and then I'm just going to call it my test.

93
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,720
Jim py file.

94
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,850
Hit save and notice once becomes a PI file.

95
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,280
What's going to happen is it's going to automatically open up all the folders there and your project

96
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,870
folder.

97
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,130
And it's also going to import that syntax highlighting which is nice and useful for us.

98
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,350
So then what we can do here is Bechet this command line.

99
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,650
Just type in Python and then begin to type in the name.

100
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,590
My test.

101
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:27,150
Jim you can just do tabbed to autocomplete there enter and you should see eventually it works.

102
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,750
Hopefully you don't get any error that says Jim not found if you're getting an error saying Jim not

103
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:38,590
found then triple check that you've activated your learning environment and that you also installed

104
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,830
Jim using pipin Solanum.

105
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,240
OK.

106
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,920
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

107
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,360
Again you pretty much have total flexibility as far as what kind of method you want to use for running

108
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,000
these dot scripts for Jim.

109
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,420
You can use the Jupiter notebook but if you ever get into bugs then I recommend that you download that

110
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,680
you print a book as it by script and then just run that PI script at your command line.

111
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,400
So if you really use the Jupiter book you could technically keep using that as well.

112
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,110
You actually don't need to switch to a text editor but I'm going to be using a text editor here just

113
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:13,390
to make sure that everyone no matter what their O S here can follow along with me with no bugs or no

114
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,310
errors when rendering their gym environments.

115
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,250
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
