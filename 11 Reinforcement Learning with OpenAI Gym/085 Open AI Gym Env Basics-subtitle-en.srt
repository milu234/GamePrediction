1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,190
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:13,530
We're going to discuss just the very basics of creating in an environment with opening gym library.

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,230
So we're going to explore how to create the carpool environment.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,070
One of the most basic environments that comes of opening a gym and it also doesn't require any additional

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,730
libraries to be installed.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,770
So let's discuss what the actual carpool problem is.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,810
So the goal of this carpooling environment is to balance the pull on the cart and the car can move left

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,650
or right and you can imagine as the cart moves around the pole will end up sliding down.

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:44,320
So we have actions available to us in order to move the cart either left or right in an attempt to balance

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,880
the pull.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,990
Well actually Theale actions in this lecture that will deal in a future lecture.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,660
But right now just keep in mind that we're going to be able to enter one of two actions either zero

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,760
for left or one for right.

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,140
So we're going to move that car left to right to try to keep it up pull balance as far as the environment

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,910
is concerned.

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,040
It's actually going to be represented with a pie array.

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,380
So even though the opening I Chim library comes a nice rendering tool so you can visualize all of this

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,740
as far as your actual model is concerned.

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,510
It's just going to receive back a number higher rate for floating point numbers and those floating point

20
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,250
numbers will indicate the horizontal position.

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,270
So there's some initial position of the cart which we mark at zero.

22
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,350
And then the horizontal position can be either to the left of that initial mark.

23
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,110
So that would be some negative number or to the right of it.

24
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,290
So we have that first horizontal position.

25
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,490
Then we also have the horizontal velocity.

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,090
So that's how fast the actual cart is moving left or right.

27
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,240
Then we also know the angle of the pole itself as well as the angular velocity of the pole as it tends

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,110
to fall down.

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:55,010
So we can grab these values from the environment that umpire and then we'll use them for our agent right

30
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,190
now let's just focus on the very basics of creating this environment.

31
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,710
So I will open up my editor or open up whatever IP you're using to create your PI scripts and follow

32
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,060
along with me.

33
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,360
Let's go to the editor now.

34
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:12,830
OK so right here we have a PI script files called my test Jim and the first thing we need to do is actually

35
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,030
import Jim.

36
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,750
So I will say import Jim and we'll just do that.

37
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,190
And now it's time to actually create or make the environment that we create or make an environment is

38
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,270
create some sort of environmental variable we'll say envy.

39
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,370
And you can ignore this kind of drop down right here.

40
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,990
It's just basic drop down help for Python but it's not necessary here.

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,660
There we're going to call Jim.

42
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,430
Well called the make method off the gym.

43
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:43,280
So you say Jim thought make and then the passing some string code for the environment some environments

44
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,890
as I've mentioned before have dependencies such as the Atari game environments require the Atari emulator.

45
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,080
But in this case we're going to be using the environment that doesn't require anything to keep things

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,180
simple and it will be just cart pole dash vs zero.

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,360
And if you want more string codes you can always just check out the documentation.

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,750
So you click on the environments page that we saw earlier and then choose any string you want.

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,500
If you get an error it's probably because you needed the pendency.

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,760
So go ahead and look up on the documentation what dependencies need to install.

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,780
So once you've made the environment what we wanted to do is reset the environment to its default starting

52
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,560
stage.

53
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,010
In our case the shifts that the car is at the Zero location.

54
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,290
So we say reset.

55
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,170
Open and close print sees on the environment.

56
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,660
And then what you can do is you can render the environment over several times steps she can say something

57
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,590
like for tea in range 1000.

58
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:44,280
So for some 1000 times steps we're going to do is we're going to render the environment and rendering

59
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,740
the environment basically creates this little pop up that allows you to view the environment.

60
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,920
And then what we're going to do here is we're going to do the following.

61
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,210
The worry about this line of code is something we're going to talk about a lot more in the next lecture.

62
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:03,120
But essentially what I'm going to do is I'm going to call the action space office environment and then

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,460
I'm going to call a sample open and close princes.

64
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,470
And what this line does the Slide 11.

65
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,740
It's basically saying take some sort of random action from the action space from the actions available

66
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,440
to us were either 0 or 1 left or right.

67
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:22,360
What this is going to do is going to randomly sample that and then provide that step into the environment.

68
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,610
So we shouldn't actually see the pull balance we should eventually just see some sort of random sliding.

69
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,280
And what should happen is that slides off the actual page.

70
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,460
So let's save this and run this so we'll say Python.

71
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,400
My test Jim that pi.

72
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,080
Just have to complete that and make sure that you're running this with your environment activated or

73
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,190
they gym installed.

74
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,930
Otherwise we're going to err enter to run this and eventually should see a little pop up there and you

75
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,040
should see it swing off the page.

76
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,790
OK.

77
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,790
So that's all we have to do.

78
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,180
Again the lines here that really focus on is you make your environment with some sort of street code.

79
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,450
Again the string codes available to you and the documentation reset the environment to the starting

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,460
position and then for a certain number of time steps you can render the environment which is what we

81
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,150
just saw.

82
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,600
And then you can't perform an read off that environment.

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,290
So we're going to focus on next as a quick note.

84
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,230
It really doesn't matter what you call this temporary variable because we don't actually use it inside

85
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,300
this for loop.

86
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,260
So it's common to just have an underscore here because underscores are typically kind of throw away

87
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,060
variables stuff you don't really end up using inside your for loops so just keep that in mind if you

88
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,900
ever see this.

89
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,300
It's really come just these underscore there.

90
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,730
All right thanks everyone.

91
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,120
And the next lecture we're going to focus on being able to take actions and reading the environment

92
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,450
I'll see it there.
