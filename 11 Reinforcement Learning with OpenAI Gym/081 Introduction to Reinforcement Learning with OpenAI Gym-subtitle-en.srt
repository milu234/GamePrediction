00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,110
Welcome everyone to this overview lecture on reinforcement learning.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,530
So is reinforcement learning reinforcement learning allows machines.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,970
And what we're later going to call software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,360
a specific contexts such as playing a game in order to maximize the performance in that context such

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,430
as getting a high score in that game.

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,400
So reinforcement learning uses a simple reward feedback and it's required for the agent to learn its

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,230
behavior.

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:43,630
And this is known as that reinforcement signal basically reinforcing good behavior.

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,600
So there's lots of different types of algorithms that fall under reinforcement learning and you should

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,360
know that not all of these algorithms actually require frameworks such as tensor flow.

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,900
Now all of them need some sort of neural network tensor flow situation.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,300
OK so let's discuss the four main things that concern reinforcement learning.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,120
And that is the agent the environment the action and the reward.

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,630
So all these four things are connected through basically a loop.

15
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,500
You have the agent which is what we're actually going to be programming you can essentially think of

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,900
that as either your network or software program et cetera.

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:27,220
The agent is going to take in observations and also a reward later on from the environment and the environment.

18
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,150
A lot of times when you're reading about reinforcement learning it's some sort of game.

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,700
It doesn't always have to be a game.

20
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,120
It can basically be anything you want it to be such as learning how to walk down a path.

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:43,000
But in this case and because we're going to be using open gym later on we'll mostly be dealing of games.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,080
But once you take an observations from that environment you get to perform an action on that environment

23
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,240
and that basically creates a loop.

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,760
So you have your agent it performs an action onto the environment such as moving a piece in whatever

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,470
specific game you're playing.

26
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:03,200
And then from that it taken observations and you also take in a reward level and the reward level basically

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,730
the finds how well you performed in that environment.

28
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,210
So let's break this down a little more formally.

29
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,610
So our agent or program or bot it can receive inputs based off the environment and it can also perform

30
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,900
actions that we have the environment itself.

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,000
That's the actual setting that the agent is interacting with.

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,630
A lot of times it's often a game and examples but it can really be any real world or artificial environment.

33
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,660
And keep in mind you need to be able to represent this environment in a way that an agent can understand.

34
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,420
So what I mean by that is that they need to be some sort of array or some sort representation that your

35
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,740
program can understand.

36
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,170
So if you're dealing with a real world environment such as teaching a robot how to walk down a hill

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,360
you're going to need to have cameras on that robot and then eventually those images need to be translated

38
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,350
to arrays that your agent can understand.

39
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,700
Now previously it was actually really difficult to create environments that were easy to use and that

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,570
were shareable.

41
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,280
But later on we're going to discover how open the eyes Jim library actually helped solve this pretty

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,530
big problem so we can actually focus on building agents instead of building all the necessary frameworks

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,570
of an environment.

44
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,210
Now as far as the action is concerned that's the actual interaction your agent will perform on the environment.

45
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,290
So you can move in an environment maybe choose the next move in a game etc..

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,620
That's the actual action.

47
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,410
Then comes the reward after you perform an action.

48
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,960
So the reward is a metric that allows your agent to understand whether or not the previous sets of actions

49
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,740
either helped or hurt in its overall goal.

50
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,070
So these four aspects are fundamental to reinforcement learning and the way open gym works with variables

51
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,090
designed to fit within this framework.

52
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,400
It's going to allow us to focus on model building.

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,650
So you're going to hear these terms again and again as we work with opening.

54
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,530
Jim and keep in mind reinforcement learning isn't just for games it's for a variety of tasks.

55
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,610
Games are just an easy way to clearly show all the major aspects of reinforcement learning.

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Which is why when you're learning about reinforcement learning it's really popular that you see it in

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,540
the setting of things like board games or simple tasks.

58
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,350
All right that's it for this lecture.

59
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,860
The next lecture we're going to discuss a little further about open gym library.

60
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,660
I'll see you there.
