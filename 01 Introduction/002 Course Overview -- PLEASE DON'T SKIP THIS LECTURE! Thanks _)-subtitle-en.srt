00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,920
Hello everyone and welcome to the course overview lecture.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,820
I have a quick favor to ask of you.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,530
Please don't skip this lecture even if you've already taken one of my courses before.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,050
This is just going to be a really useful quick lecture on where to find a lot of important things for

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,040
the course.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,010
So welcome to the course.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,790
I'm going to cover the best practices for taking this course where you can find the notes for this course.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,250
How to ask questions to quickly get help and then a little bit of certification and then I'm also going

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:37,540
to talk about the curriculum for the course Ok far first best practices for the course are concerned.

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,040
Keep in mind that videos can be sped up up to speed.

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,980
They can also be slowed down so I tend to talk at a pretty steady pace.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,110
So me personally I would actually probably speed up the videos the way I consume information.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,610
But maybe if English isn't your first language or you want to slow things down you can also slow the

14
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,930
speed of the videos.

15
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,860
You can also check the video playback quality.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,410
So there's a little gear setting.

17
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,840
If you notice the videos are blurry.

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,320
Are you having any trouble with them.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,880
You can always up the quality.

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,810
All the videos are uploaded in 10 ADP.

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,280
Also you can use the curriculum tab to quickly navigate between lectures and if you have any other problems

22
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,190
with the platform maybe the videos are taking too long or they're buffering.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,180
You can always email a question to support you to me dot com and they they're happy to help you out.

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,080
Or you can submit a request directly at the U to me support page.

25
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,260
Again I only make the lectures and the notes and content.

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,150
I don't actually control the platform.

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,330
So for platform issues please go ahead and send an email to support UMT dot com.

28
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,270
Lot of great folks there and they're happy to help you out.

29
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,300
Two more quick notes.

30
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,680
As far as best practices for taking the course I would recommend you always watch the videos and reference

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,970
the notebook's tensor fluid deep learning can be quite a complicated subject.

32
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,740
So I tried my best to really clarify things during the videos and then you can always reference the

33
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,530
notebooks because the code itself is pretty complex.

34
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,900
So you want to make sure that the code you're writing matches the notebooks Exactly.

35
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,540
Also I recommend you always use the Course environment file with the provided notebooks and when I say

36
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,500
with the provided notebooks I don't just mean just copying and paste code from the notebooks.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,640
Try running the notebook files directly.

38
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,720
It's really really easy to make a typo and a lot of this code goes for many lines and it's quite complicated

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,330
because it's a pretty complex topic so the notes are there for you so you can always reference them.

40
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,740
OK so speaking of the notes where can you find them.

41
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,470
Well the notebooks and all the data files we use are available as a large zip file and it's a resource

42
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,840
link in this lecture.

43
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,510
It's also available for you in the very next lecture as a resource link.

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,950
It's the same file so whichever one you want go ahead and download it.

45
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,310
It's a pretty large zip file because it includes some larger data sets so it may take a little bit of

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,470
time to download.

47
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,430
As far as the slides that you're going to see throughout the course these are all Google slides and

48
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,950
they're linked to in the first lecture of their respective section.

49
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,870
So what I mean by that.

50
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,310
If you're looking for the slides for the convolutional in your own networks section you just go to that

51
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,390
sections first lecture and you should see as a resource link the link to the Google slides.

52
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,220
Again why you're watching this video.

53
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,830
You should see like a little blue or some sort of pop up a little link and it should take you to the

54
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,890
resources Okay now how to ask questions and quickly get help.

55
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,030
During the course.

56
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,530
So the first thing you should do is verify that you ran the provided notebook file from that zip file

57
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,320
and you did it inside the provided environment file that we'll talk about during the installation lecture.

58
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:38,000
All the Knope the code has been checked against this provided environment file so it should all run

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,060
if you're running that exact notebook in the environment file with no other edits.

60
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,130
So keep that in mind if you're getting any syntax errors.

61
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,020
It's probably because you copied and pasted something wrong or you have a small typo or you're not running

62
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,490
it in the provided environment.

63
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,650
So always make sure that you're doing that.

64
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:01,600
All right so let's quickly go over some steps for getting answers to your questions in a quick and reliable

65
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,460
manner.

66
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,700
The first thing I would always suggest is that you check that you actually ran the notebook and that

67
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,750
you also check the videos.

68
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,790
A lot of times the videos I make some comments trying to preemptively answer questions that I may think

69
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,620
arise.

70
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,190
So if you're concerned about a particular section of the notebook go ahead and see if you can find that

71
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,730
in the video.

72
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,930
When I go over that I usually make some comments about it.

73
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,160
If not what I would recommend doing is just a quick Google search of whatever area are getting or whatever

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,200
question you have.

75
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,270
There's usually lots of useful pre asked questions on stack overflow that will cover the same topics

76
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,350
or same errors that you're experiencing.

77
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,420
And that way you can answer your questions in just a few seconds through a quick Google search.

78
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,940
So again with such a complex topic Google is your friend and stack overflow is a great resource and

79
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,780
I highly recommend that the first thing you do whenever you have a question is just do a quick Google

80
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,030
search or do a search on stack overflow.

81
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,350
OK let's say you still can't find your answer.

82
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,710
Well you can always search the Frequently Asked Questions lexer.

83
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,440
That's the very next lecture.

84
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,850
Now those are just general questions.

85
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,890
They usually have to do more if the course or getting certified or where you can find the notes that

86
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,560
sort of thing.

87
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,700
Or maybe even the installation process.

88
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,830
If you have a question that's more specific to maybe how a line in the notebook works and you didn't

89
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,390
get your answer either through stack overflow or through the videos that I would recommend the search

90
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,350
previous question and answer post.

91
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,690
We're going to end up having thousands of students in this course and in the getter channel as well.

92
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,030
So you want to search those question answer forums to see if your questions are already answered there.

93
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,710
All right so let's say you tried all that you did a google search.

94
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,490
Try looking on stack overflow.

95
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,970
You search the Frequently Asked Questions lecture you search the Q&amp;A forums and still can't find an

96
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,610
answer.

97
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,310
No problem.

98
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,250
That's the point of the Q&amp;A forms.

99
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,190
So make sure that when you're posting to the Q&amp;A forums you include your main error or your main point

100
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,780
in confusion.

101
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,780
Try to make this as clear as possible.

102
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,380
And also it's really helpful if you link to resources or Stack Overflow links that you've already seen.

103
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,760
That way you don't accidentally just get a reply to a stack overflow link that you've already seen and

104
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,260
maybe they didn't understand.

105
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,940
I would also really recommend that if you're stuck on a particular point in the lecture that you include

106
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,190
a video time stamp.

107
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,260
So let's say minute 12 of lecture 45.

108
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,970
That way we know what you're referencing and if necessary include a screenshot.

109
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,490
If your errors are pretty strange or it's more of a visual thing that's hard to describe screenshots

110
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,830
really help out a lot.

111
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,830
If you have a particular installation issue make sure you include information about your operating system

112
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,660
and the particular procedure you followed OK.

113
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,170
Quick note on certification.

114
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,280
You can check out the resource link for the support page details.

115
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,150
Me has a support page that goes through the full details of how to get certified.

116
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,370
If you take the course and as a quick note if you have any issues with your certificate maybe it's taking

117
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,450
too long or you just want to change the name.

118
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,900
Go get an email support you to me that again they're happy to help you out.

119
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,760
I don't actually control anything about certification.

120
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,800
It's all done automatically through to me.

121
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,500
So support me dot com can always help and they're happy to answer any questions about your certification

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,250
OK.

123
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,740
Let's quickly describe the course curriculum right after this.

124
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,260
We're going to talk about the installation and setup of python and flow and your environment.

125
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,330
Then after that we're going to do a very quick overview of machine learning just a little quick refresher

126
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,400
so you can get your mindset ready for the course.

127
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,320
Then we have what we call a crash course section in that section of the course.

128
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,850
We're going to go over things like pi Panchos and sikat learn.

129
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,080
If you've already taken one of my courses such as the Python for data science and machine learning boot

130
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,740
camp you may already be familiar of those libraries so you don't actually need to do the crash course

131
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,030
in which case you can skip it completely.

132
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,040
Or if you want to make sure you understand.

133
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,540
Go ahead and check out the crash course exercises and the solutions.

134
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,370
Just so you can check your understanding.

135
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,730
Again that crash course.

136
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,760
A little bit optional depending on what your prior experiences with those libraries.

137
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,390
OK so you did the crash course then we're going to move on to an introduction to neural networks.

138
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,130
So in that section of the Course we actually don't touch tensor flow.

139
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,290
Well we end up doing as we go through the very basics of neural networks.

140
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,600
We have a very shallow learning curve there.

141
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,030
I don't want to just like rev up the engines and then have you be lost at the very first sight of a

142
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,660
neural network.

143
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,580
So instead what we do is we have a very slow general introduction to neural networks and then what's

144
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:21,000
really cool is we manually create a neural network framework using python that sort of mimics the tensor

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,990
flow framework.

146
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,710
So actually in that intersection we don't touch tensor flow.

147
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,090
Instead we try to build out a little copy of tensor flow manually that way once we actually reach sensor

148
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,890
flow you have a full and complete understanding.

149
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,010
After that section is complete we then have what I refer to as the tensor flow sections.

150
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,660
And these are the sections of the course that really tackle a particular network topic and show you

151
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,060
how you can work with tensor flow.

152
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,510
So they typically include a theory lecture then an implementation example intenser flow and then some

153
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,230
sort of exercise free to follow intenser flow.

154
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,290
So those are all going to be dependent on whatever topic we're discussing so you'll have a tensor flow

155
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,890
section on recurrent and that works convolutional neural networks auto encoders etc..

156
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,300
Everything we talked about in the previous video and last but not least I just want to give a HUGE THANK

157
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,040
YOU to all the students who have rolled not just in this course but all my courses it really means a

158
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,100
lot to me and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to teach you.

159
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:18,730
All right.

160
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,850
So without any further ado let's go continue on with the rest of the course.
