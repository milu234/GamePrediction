Welcome to the complete guide to tensor flow for deep learning of Python.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,490
My name is Jose Portsea and I'll be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,470
I currently have over a quarter of a million students on me teaching various topics such as Python machine

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,950
learning data science finance and more.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,990
I'm also a technical corporate trainer for Fortune 500 companies and this course will teach you how

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,250
to use Google's tensor framework to perform the latest cutting edge techniques in machine learning.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,890
This course is based off the same deep learning material I've developed for some of the world's top

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,180
tech companies.

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,250
Let's give you a quick overview of the course curriculum.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,920
We'll start off a brief crash course in the central Python data science library including some Peiffer

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:50,520
numerical processing Pandurs for data analysis that plotted for visualization utilizing sikat learn

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,510
for processing machine learning data sets.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,260
Once we done with the crash course we'll focus on building an intuitive understanding of the basics

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,670
of neural that works including trance activation functions back propagation and more after those neural

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,550
network basics.

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,370
We'll explore how to unlock the full potential of deep learning with tensor flow.

17
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,170
In this course we cover a variety of ways.

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,300
We'll begin the course by understanding basic artificial neural networks such as densely connected networks

19
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,050
will learn how to use these for basic classification and regression tests afterwards we'll work on understanding

20
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:34,520
convolutional here that works eventually using them to solve complex image classification tasks that

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,990
will move on to creating recurrent neural networks including the latest topics in the field such as

22
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,390
long or short term memory units and gaitered recurrent recurrent that works you'll be able to analyze

23
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,890
sequences of data such as Time series will also cover other models such as the words of an algorithm

24
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,100
for word and beddings allowing us to map individual words to vectors and explore the relationships between

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,850
will cover how to use auto encoders perform unsupervised tasks that works this course even covers advanced

26
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,690
topics such as generative adversarial networks and how to use reinforcement learning algorithms.

27
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,900
The open AI will teach networks how to solve tasks such as playing video games of this course you'll

28
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,120
get clear video explanations for every topic including easy to understand slides to cover theoretical

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,130
aspects in an intuitive way and fully coded notebooks to easily reference the code shown in the course.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,740
Not only do you get great technical content but you'll also get access to our online question and answer

31
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,910
forms and or chat room recone go for quick help and talk with thousands of other students.

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,960
Upon completion of this course you'll also get a certificate of completion that you can post on your

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,650
LinkedIn profile to show off to your colleagues and potential employers all of this comes with a 30
